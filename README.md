Cindy Sharp, the Cherished Creations CEO just sent you an email. She needs your help to prepare a presentation for the board meeting.

**Objectives**

- Tell the story of the company's growth, using trended performance data
- Use the database to explain some of the details around the company's growth story
- Analyze current performance and use the data available to assess upcoming opportunities

**Problem Questions**

1. Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our busienss. Could you pull **monthly trends** for **gsearch sessions and orders** so that we can showcase the growth there?

2. Next, it would be great to see a similar trend for gsearch, but this time **splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately**. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.

3. While we're on gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull **monthly sessions and orders split by device type**? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.

4. I'm worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from gsearch. Can you pull **monthly trends for gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?**

5. I'd like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull **session to order conversion rates, by month**?

6. For the gsearch lander test, please **estimate the revenue that test earned us** (**Hint:** Look at the increase in CVR from the test (JUn 19 - Jul 28), and use nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)

7. For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to shows a **full conversion funnel from each of the two pages to orders**. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 - Jul 28).

8. I'd love for you to **quantify the impact of our billing test**, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 - Nov 10), in terms of **revenue per billing page sessions**, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.

</details> 
## Insight and Visualization

### üîç Q1: Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our busienss. Could you pull **monthly trends** for **gsearch sessions and orders** so that we can showcase the growth there?
<br>

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT((DATE_PART('month', website_sessions.created_at)),'-',
  (DATE_PART('year', website_sessions.created_at)))as Month_Year,
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)*100.0)/
    (COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id)),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN orders
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE utm_source = 'gsearch' and website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' and '2015-01-01'
GROUP BY 1;
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult1.png"></kbd>
<br>
Gsearch traffic shows steady growth of sessions and orders.
<br>

### üîç Q2: Next, it would be great to see a similar trend for gsearch, but this time **splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately**. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.
<br>

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT((DATE_PART('month', website_sessions.created_at)),'-',
  (DATE_PART('year', website_sessions.created_at)))as Month_Year,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='brand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as brand_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='brand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_orders,
   ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='brand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END)*100.0)/
    (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='brand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS brand_cvr,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='nonbrand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as nonbrand_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_orders,
  ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='nonbrand' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END)*100.0)/
    (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_campaign='nonbrand' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS nonbrand_cvr
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN orders
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE utm_source = 'gsearch' and website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' and '2015-01-01'
GROUP BY 1;
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult2.png"></kbd>
<br>

In the early days of brand campaign, the conversion rate is very high at 9.23%, though the number of sessions and orders are still considered low compared to nonbrand campaign. The brand sessions and orders do increase steadily every month, and while still lower than nonbrand, in November its conversion rate still shows higher number than nonbrand (4.44% vs 4.19% for brand and nonbrand, respectively).
<br>

### üîç Q3: While we're on gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull **monthly sessions and orders split by device type**? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.
<br>

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT((DATE_PART('month', website_sessions.created_at)),'-',
  (DATE_PART('year', website_sessions.created_at)))as Month_Year,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='desktop'  THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as desktop_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='desktop' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_orders,
   ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='desktop' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END)*100.0)/
    (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='desktop' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS desktop_cvr,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='mobile' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) as mobile_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='mobile' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_orders,
  ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='mobile' THEN orders.order_id ELSE NULL END)*100.0)/
    (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type='mobile' THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS mobile_cvr
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN orders
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE utm_source = 'gsearch' 
AND utm_campaign='nonbrand'
and website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' and '2015-01-01'
GROUP BY 1;
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult3.png"></kbd>

<br>

Majority of traffic sources are coming from users on desktop. Both desktop and mobile shows increased conversion rate from March to November 2012. Investigate why there are less session and orders from users who access through mobile, look into the the mobile webpages user interface and experience. 
<br>

### üîç Q4: I'm worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from gsearch. Can you pull **monthly trends for gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?**

First, find the various utm sources and referers to see the traffic we're getting
<br>

```sql
SELECT utm_source,utm_campaign,HTTP_referer,COUNT(*) FROM website_sessions
WHERE website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2012-01-01' and '2013-01-01'
GROUP BY utm_source,utm_campaign,HTTP_referer;
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult4_1.png"></kbd>
<br>

- If utm_source and utm_campaign IS NULL and http_referer IS NOT NULL, it means the sessions come from organic search sessions
- If utm_source and utm_campaign IS NULL and http_referer IS NULL, it means the sessions come directly from the web / users directly type the website link 

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT((DATE_PART('month', website_sessions.created_at)),'-',
  (DATE_PART('year', website_sessions.created_at)))as Month_Year,COUNT(website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS gsearch_paid_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS bsearch_paid_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS organic_search_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN website_sessions.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS direct_type_sessions
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN orders
    ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' and '2015-01-01'
GROUP BY 1;
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult4_2.png"></kbd>
<br>

Number of sessions keep growing every month. Large portion of sessions come from gsearch, starting at 99% at March though it starts to decreased and contribute to 70% of total sessions in November. Bsearch traffic starts to grow in August, contributing to 12% of total and reach its highest in November at 22% of total sessions.

### üîç Q5: I'd like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull **session to order conversion rates, by month**?

```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT((DATE_PART('month', website_sessions.created_at)),'-',
  (DATE_PART('year', website_sessions.created_at)))as Month_Year,
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND((COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)*100.0)/
    (COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id)),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN orders
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE utm_source = 'gsearch' and website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2012-03-01' AND '2012-11-01'
GROUP BY 1;
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult5.png"></kbd>
<br>


### üîç Q6: For the gsearch lander test, please **estimate the revenue that test earned us** (**Hint:** Look at the increase in CVR from the test (JUn 19 - Jul 28), and use nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_test_pv
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = '/lander-1';
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult6_1.png"></kbd>
<br>

The first website pageview id for lander test page is 23504

```sql
SELECT
  website_pageviews.pageview_url AS landing_page,
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT orders.order_id)*100.0/
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_sessions.website_session_id),2) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions
INNER JOIN website_pageviews
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
LEFT JOIN orders
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE website_pageviews.website_pageview_id >= 23504
  AND website_sessions.created_at BETWEEN '2012-06-19' AND '2012-07-28'
  AND website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
  AND website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/home', '/lander-1')
GROUP BY website_pageviews.pageview_url;
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult6_2.png"></kbd>
<br>

Homepage lander conversion rate's is 3.18%, while new test lander page's conversion rate is 4.06%. The conversion rate is increased by 0.88%.

To calculate estimate revenue generated by new test lander page, first we find the last time /home page appeared, then we count the total sessions since that.

```sql
SELECT
  MAX(website_sessions.website_session_id) AS most_recent_gsearch_nonbrand_home_pageview
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
  ON website_sessions.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
WHERE utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
  AND pageview_url = '/home' -- Home landing page
  AND website_sessions.created_at < '2012-11-27';
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult6_3.png"></kbd>
<br>

- Max website_session_id for /home is 17145
- After this session, there are no more /home landing page, and all landing page has been replaced with /lander-1

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(website_session_id) AS sessions_since_test
FROM website_sessions
WHERE
  created_at < '2012-11-27'
  AND website_session_id >= 17145 -- last home session
  AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand';
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult6_4.png"></kbd>
<br>

**Calculate Average Revenue:**
- Conversion rate difference: 0.88%
- Total of sessions using `/lander-1` = 22,973
- 22,973 x 0.88% = estimated at least 202 incremental orders since July 29 using `\lander-1` page for roughly 4 months
- 202/4 = 50 additional orders per month. Awesome!!

### üîç Q7: For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to shows a **full conversion funnel from each of the two pages to orders**. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 - Jul 28)

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_test_pv
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE pageview_url = '/lander-1';
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult7_1.png"></kbd>
<br>

-- First test lander-1 pageviews is 23504

```sql
SELECT
  website_sessions.website_session_id,
  website_pageviews.pageview_url,
  website_pageviews.created_at AS pageview_created_at,
  CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/home' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS home_page,
  CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/lander-1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS lander1_page,

  CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/shipping' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS shipping_page,
  CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/billing' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS billing_page,
  CASE WHEN pageview_url = '/thank-you-for-your-order' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS thankyou_page
FROM website_sessions
  LEFT JOIN website_pageviews
    ON website_sessions.website_session_id = website_pageviews.website_session_id
WHERE
  website_sessions.utm_source = 'gsearch'
  AND website_sessions.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
  AND website_pageview_id >= 23504
  AND website_pageviews.created_at < '2012-07-28'
  AND website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/home', '/lander-1', '/products', '/the-original-mr-fuzzy', '/cart', '/shipping', '/billing', '/thank-you-for-your-order')

The custom lander page has better click through rates than the original homepage.

### üîç Q8: I'd love for you to **quantify the impact of our billing test**, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 - Nov 10), in terms of **revenue per billing page sessions**, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.

```sql
SELECT
  billing_version_seen,
  COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions,
  ROUND(SUM(price_usd) / COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id), 2) AS revenue_per_session
FROM
(
SELECT
  website_pageviews.website_session_id,
  website_pageviews.pageview_url AS billing_version_seen,
  orders.order_id,
  orders.price_usd
FROM website_pageviews
  LEFT JOIN orders
    ON website_pageviews.website_session_id = orders.website_session_id
WHERE
  website_pageviews.created_at BETWEEN '2012-09-10' and '2012-11-10'
  AND website_pageviews.pageview_url IN ('/billing', '/billing-2')
) AS billing_pageviews_and_order_data
GROUP BY 1;
```

- `/billing` page generates 657 sessions, with average USD 22,83 revenue per session
- `/billing-2` page generates 654 sessions, with average USD 31,34 revenue per session
- **INCREASE: USD 8.51 per session**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(website_session_id) AS billing_sessions_past_month
FROM website_pageviews
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-10-27' AND '2012-11-27'
  AND pageview_url IN ('/billing', '/billing-2');
```
<br>
<kbd><img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/padhu-bot/Cherished_Creations-SQLAnalysis/blob/main/QueryResults/QueryResult8_2.png"></kbd>

<strong>
Recommendation:
</strong>
</summary>
<br>
1. With most of our users coming from desktop, we can focus our campaign and budget to desktop users. Additionally, evalute the mobile webpage and find why the traffic is low, then create a better user interface and experience for mobile users.
<br>
2. For paid marketing campaigns, most of the sessions come from gsearch than bsearch. We can focus our budget and campaign to gsearch for higher sessions reach in the future.
